    "This project was carried out as a real-world application of Python's unsupervised learning clustering algorithm to segregate neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada, into clusters with similar high numbers of venue categories.Marketing campaigns can be streamlined and made efficient by companies who wish to market products and services to targeted businesses in Toronto, using insight from v. Also, real estate agencies can gain insight into the unique selling points of different neighborhoods with regard to the proximity to venues of different categories. This could influence the pricing of properties and ultimately boost profits. Businesses in the travel space can provide customers with high-level information that can minimize churn rate.\n",

    "Why Toronto, Canada? Initially, I set out to carry out this project in my home country of Ghana, which does not have enough data available on the internet to draw meaningful conclusions from. On the other end of the spectrum, developed nations like the U.S.A, England, France, and Germany had extra data available in different formats on the internet. I needed to find a happy medium.\n",
    "I have come to learn that a large part of a data scientist's job is data wrangling. Hence, as a test case, Toronto has just enough data available on the web to apply Python's Beautiful Soup and pgeocode libraries, which I will need in the future. Additionally, Foursquare has curated data on businesses in Toronto, so I was able to practice making calls to Foursquare's API and parsing the resulting json file to extract needed data. Toronto, allowed me to get real feedback on skills and concept I learnt in courses and pushed me to learn more and better ways to collect and clean data."

Data on venues within a 500m radius of neighborhoods in Toronto was collected by making calls to Foursquare's API."
